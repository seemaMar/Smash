Project 3: Smash - Part 3

Author: Seema Marahatta
Class: CS253

Overview
This program behaves like bash would. The user is prompted to input something.
If the input is a recognized command, it'll run as expected (hopefully), else
you'll be returned the postion of your words.
The history command will remind you of your inputs.

Compiling and Using
In order to compile this program, find the proper directory holding the project.
Type 'make', upon inspection you'll realize you have an executable smash now,
simply type ./smash next. Now you can input anything you want.

Testing
Parts 1 and 2 of smash were thoroughly tested using the autograder.
For the third part however, I had to redo the first two sections becasue
I was unable to find a way to run execvp with my old code.
